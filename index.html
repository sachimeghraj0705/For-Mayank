    Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.  
    I don’t think you realize how much you mean to me. Even though we are going 
    through a lot right now i just want you to know whether we are meant to be or not 
    i love you and meant it when i said it. Also i really wanted to celebrate valentine'
    this year and was hoping cause we barely celebrated any special day but  <s></s>
    seems like the universe doesnt so i just made this lil something for you. I hope you
    like it cause i have been planing this since before we took a break.
    I’m grateful for every laugh, every conversation, and every quiet moment we share.  
    I care about you more than I can ever properly put into words. ❤️
