    <h1>Mayank,</h1>

    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, Baby.</p>

    <p>
      I don’t think you realize how much you mean to me.
      Even though we are going through a lot right now,
      I just want you to know that whether we are meant to be or not,
      I love you and I meant it when I said it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I really wanted to celebrate Valentine’s this year.
      I was hoping we could, because we barely get to celebrate
      any special days together.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it seems like the universe had other plans,
      so I made this little something for you instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope you like it, because I’ve been planning this
      since before we took a break.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m grateful for every laugh, every conversation,
      and every quiet moment we share.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care about you more than I can ever properly put into words. ❤️
    </p>
